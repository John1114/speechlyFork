With Speechly's cloud API and open source client libraries you can add voice features to any website or mobile application. Our free tier allows 50 hours of API usage which is enough for small-to-medium scale projects.

Also take a look at our [demos](https://www.speechly.com/demos/) to see what you can build with Speechly.

# Getting started

1. Take a look at our [Quickstart documentation](https://docs.speechly.com/quick-start/).
2. Create an account on the [Speechly Dashboard](https://www.speechly.com/dashboard).
3. Profit.

(Okay, actually we should probably put some instructions on how to get e.g. the browser-client-example up and running with an app id that has the empty configuration deployed.)

# Client libraries
The client libraries work together with our cloud API. They take care of audio capture and streaming, authentication, and network connection handling.

For "Vanilla JS" projects we recommend the Speechly [browser-client](libraries/browser-client).

For React users we provide a more idiomatic client library, the [react-client](libraries/react-client).

Note: client libraries for mobile platforms can be found in their own repositories: [Android](https://github.com/speechly/android-client) and [iOS](https://github.com/speechly/ios-client).

# UI components
In addition to the basic functionality of the client libraries, the Speechly UI components address various Voice UI tasks:

- [Browser-ui](libraries(browser-ui)
- [React-ui](libraries/react-ui)
- [Voice forms](libraries/voice-forms)
